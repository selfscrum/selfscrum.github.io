Nextcloud as a communication solution is waiting in my backlog for a long time. Again and again something else came up - now I have a real use case. The Git for Kids Learning Circle has started for the first time and apart from zoom, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a communication platform yet. What could be more obvious than to finally test Nextcloud?
In view of the latest data protection legislation, it has also become clear once again that we have to move, we as consumers of the large platforms.</description></item></channel></rss>
