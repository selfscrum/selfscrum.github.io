As we are about to expand the school for secondary schooling, there is a lot to think about and organise. In addition, due to fluctuation of active association members, some &amp;ldquo;onboarding activities&amp;rdquo; are pending, i.e. knowledge carriers disappear and new ones new introductions.
For this reason, we have arranged an all-day kick-off meeting with the concept team for the project this weekend, which should enable us to translate our high school vision into tangible work templates and guidelines.</description></item></channel></rss>
