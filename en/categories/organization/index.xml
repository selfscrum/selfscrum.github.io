When discussing Markdown, I hear often the &amp;ldquo;user acceptance&amp;rdquo; scepticism. Which is a pity since I think Markdown is actually easier than word. In my opinition,it is really necessary to get rid of the big office suites to get efficient processes, as I wrote here recently. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use office apps, but not for tasks you better streamline.
Maybe this list helps to clarify the efficiency and acceptance perception ;)</description></item><item><title>Designing Digital Concept Workshops</title><link>https://www.selfscrum.org/en/article/workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selfscrum.org/en/article/workshop/</guid><description>We do not invent and test our concepts in a vacuum, but in connection with the development of the alternative school Freie Schule Ostfriesland. As we are about to expand the school for secondary schooling, there is a lot to think about and organise. In addition, due to fluctuation of active association members, some &amp;ldquo;onboarding activities&amp;rdquo; are pending, i.e. knowledge carriers disappear and new ones new introductions.
For this reason, we have arranged an all-day kick-off meeting with the concept team for the project this weekend, which should enable us to translate our high school vision into tangible work templates and guidelines.</description></item></channel></rss>
